## Here are some things I hate
- Facetime - Its not even that secure and why only for Apple?
- SMS - The **MOST** unsafe way to communicate in my opinion
- Facebook - Zuck likes his big buck so he must suck and steal your data
- Snapchat - Why in the ever living f**k would there be an app to actively locate people and make it almost impossible to turn it off?
- Google - Yes, they are a really good company and I use their tools alot but like they track EVERYTHING through their Google Analytics, Google Ads, Google Adsense, Google Admob, etc
- Apple - Yes... they track. Barely any customization, overpriced as hell, just a money hungry company. If they hire Steve Jobs again I will remove them from this list.
- School - Why do I have to learn the pathagory ethereum. Ask any middle aged person what the pathagory ethereum and their brain will start to glitch. 
- Temu - Yes they are cheap... do you know why? Its because they track you and sell your data. NEVER USE IT AND UNINSTALL IT!!!
- Twitter - I dont care it will forever be Twitter. Elon turning it to garbage not gonna lie. 
- Adobe - Great tools but not for the price. $55 monthly is waay too much. Just use like Affinity or Davinchi instead.
- The FAA - Dude let me just launch my missle in peace PLEASE!
- Discord - I use it everyday but they track literally EVERYTHING. Go to my how to stay hidden blog post for a example.
- Nginx - Its great but like why so complicated. Caddy is just so easy.
- Cpanel - Why is it so overpriced again? Use Webmin or DirectAdmin instead. 
- Ionos - They deleted my server and said "my bad". Props to Bob with IT support tho he was actuality helpful. Use BilligerHost instead

*Still working on this just ran out of time :)*
