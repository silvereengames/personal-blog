# How to remove yourself from the internet and stay private
Yes... although it may not seem like it, many large companies are collecting data from you, every minute, every day.

In this post, I will tell you how to completely remove as much of your data as you can from the internet and some tools you can use to 
make sure your identity stays private going foward. 

## Removing your data
Your data is everywhere on the web. Don't believe me? Try searching up your name. Now you may or may not find much information about yourself
but there is this little thing called Google search query parameters. These parameters allow you to only search specific websites and file types. 
For example if your name is John Doe, you can search `"John Doe" filetype:pdf`. This will search for you exact name, in this case `John Doe` with the 
file type of PDF. And now wow, every PDF document on the web with your name in it will appear right in front you. These documents can be detailed 
with names, phone numbers, occupations, education, addresses, and all sorts of personal information.
