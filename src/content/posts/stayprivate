# How to remove yourself from the internet and stay private
Yes... although it may not seem like it, many large companies are collecting data from you, every minute, every day.

In this post, I will tell you how to completely remove as much of your data as you can from the internet and some tools you can use to 
make sure your identity stays private going foward. 

## Removing your data
Your data is everywhere on the web. Don't believe me? Try searching up your name. Now you may or may not find much information about yourself
but there is this little thing called Google search query parameters. These parameters allow you to only search specific websites and file types. 
For example if your name is John Doe, you can search `"John Doe" filetype:pdf`. This will search for you exact name, in this case `John Doe` with the 
file type of PDF. And now wow, every PDF document on the web with your name in it will appear right in front you. These documents can be detailed 
with names, phone numbers, occupations, education, addresses, and all sorts of personal information. So how do we remove it?

First: You have a right to your privacy so you can request that your data is taken down. Usually these documents have a contact email address.
You can send a simple email requesting your data is taken down.

Second: Another way other parties may get your personal data is through social media. Most people use at least one social media platform. Usually,
most people like to post updates or what they are doing online. Such as where you are, what your doing, etc. Another things is Snap Maps. This feature
allows anyone who you have friended on Snapchat to see where you currently are. You can see why this can be an issue. I reccomend setting your social media
platforms to friends only or completely private that way no third parties get your data. Better yet not use any social media at all but in todays 
generation this might not a possibility.
