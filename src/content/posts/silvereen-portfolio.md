So recently people have been telling me I have to make a portfolio... Now I agree with that and I originally bought the silvereen.dev domain just for a portfolio but ive owned this domain for many months and its just been sitting there until I finally found time to put a blog up. Now a blog is not a portfolio but it is *something*. Currently this blog servers as my portfolio(ish) but I really just made this as a placeholder until I can find time to make a real stunning portfolio. For these types of this there is no half assing it. Portfolio's represent you as a developer and your skill level and dedication. As someone who hires people all the time myself, seeing someone with a stunning portfolio just shows me how good of a dev they are rather then what some people do and just put dome basic html and css. For me, at least, this is a go big or go home sorta thing and I definetly want to go big. I've started some basic ideas on how i'm gonna do this its just gonna take a bit for me to code something really cool up.
