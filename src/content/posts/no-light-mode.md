Why do we as a society still default to light mode sometimes? Like most sites **do** offer a dark mode but they just default to light mode... Whyyyy?!?!?!?

For example I just booted this nice new GitHub Codespace to write this post in and guess what... IT DEFAULTS TO LIGHT MODE AHHHHH HELP!!!

Even this blog for some reason sometimes defaults to lightmode. The worst part is I can't save your eyes and turn it off!

The best thing is when your on your phone late at night and you go onto a website and you are then blinded forever. AHHH!

And for the sites who don't yet have a dark mode (such as like every Google product), they should either make a dark mode or ceise to exist entirely. Save my eyes ðŸ˜­.
