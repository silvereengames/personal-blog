Why do we as a society still default to light mode sometimes? Like most sites **do** offer a dark mode but they just default to light mode... Whyyyy?!?!?!?

For example I just booted this nice new GitHub Codespace to write this post in and guess what... IT DEFAULTS TO LIGHT MODE AHHHHH HELP!!!

Even this blog for some reason sometimes defaults to lightmode. The worst part is I can't save your eyes and turn it off!

The best thing is when your on your phone late at night and you go onto a website and you are then blinded forever. AHHH!

And for the sites who don't yet have a dark mode (such as like every Google product), they should either make a dark mode or ceise to exist entirely. Save my eyes ðŸ˜­.

You may say "just use dark reader duh" but sometimes its not really that simple because some sites just arent supported. For example I use NodeRED alot for automating stuff and this is how it looks with dark reader:

Dark Reader is great for most websites but there is a select amount of websites out there that just don't work with Dark Reader. 

My main point that i'm trying to get at here is why do we have to download external extensions such as Dark Reader to do a task that every website should have. We already established almost 10 years ago and we all agreed that Dark Mode is better... so then why doesn't one of the top tech companies (Google) adopt it?
